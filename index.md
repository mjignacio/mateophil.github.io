## Problem Definition

Larceny is the unlawful taking or theft of property from a person or business. This term could range from an individual to a coordinated group which provides opportunity to get more granular. Specifically this targets individuals who steal for themselves or from necessity. The model is not intended to predict large scale operations but struggling families who need the basics to survive. 

Products like groceries, personal care products, and suitable clothes for the season are the kinds of items that people need for survival. In desperation crime seems like a suitable solution and it is hard to blame a person if there is no where left to go. Food and diapers are commonly shoplifted due to necesity so instead of legally punishing people, furthering their struggle, instead communities can come together to uplift those in need.

I personally imagine applying this data science effort to San Francisco California because I am familiar with the area personally and it is highly applicable to the city.
