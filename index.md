## Goal

Data collected from retailers will be used to train a model for predicting where shoplifting will be committed and what kinds of items are being targeted. This will be analyzed to determine the best locations to provide resources to the communities, dissuading the need for crime at least momentarily. 

## Problem Definition

For some, shoplifting is the only option to achieve basic human needs. Supplies like water, food, clothes, and feminine products recent increased prices have made them inaccessible to some. Punishing them legally only makes a bad situation worse and does not provide a solution to prevent the same thing from happening again. 

Larceny is the legal term used for unlawful taking of property from a business or person. Shoplifting is a term used for theft of merchandise with value less than $950. These specific forms of larceny are the target we aim to understand for their underlying implications to provide some assistance. 

## Inspiration

After researching within the predictive policing domain for the duration of the course, it became clear the models can be useful but are flawed. The guiding purposes for models end up harmful to people and communities they target for the policeâ€™s authoritative presence. An example of a model that has potential makes predictions of where crime will occur to dispatch police to catch it in action. This has implications of purpose targeting due to the historical data they train the models on. To get a new result the underlying socio economic issues that force people to commit crimes must be studied to be remedied.
