## Collection and Measurement Techniques

## Concerns with Collection and Measurement 

With the data collection from the police, there is a big issue with the data collection of crime. The veneer with data driven policing methods is that it can be used to reduce crime and by showing police strength and authority in areas against criminals. In reality, these methods perpetuate the biased tendencies of the officers that have come before them. Due to a long history of biased decisions made by police to target people of color, bias is baked into police data and deeply interwoven into things that do not appear to have underlying issues.
