## Ethical Concerns with Modeling and Analyzing the Data

With respect to the legal norm it should be expected that people who commit crimes should face justice for their actions. This is opposed by the goal presented and usage of the models instead of punishing, the intended treatment is mercy.
 
Is this fair treatment? Does this gentle treatment of low income individuals follow the unbiased position that should be expected of data scientists. The intentions are clearly set to  When there is a situation where two stores have equal amounts of high shoplifting rates but one is in an affluent and the other is in a low income area, it cannot be fair to pick a location.​ The outspoken intention is to help people from low income communities which would unfairly place their importance over other areas. We have claimed the responsibility to decide that people who commit a crime should be treated differently because of their intentions and history. This is contradictory to the legal basis of blind justice where everyone of any status should be treated equally. Since the course of action with the predictions is to give to the community instead of sending police, will that redeem intentional unfairness? 

Can we change people's survival mechanisms or habits? There are people who don’t steal for their survival but steal for more deeply rooted issues. People’s habits are in some part built on their outlook on life. If they do not care for others or their own lives then this momentary relief is surely not enough to give them a reason to live differently. It can be seen as a bandaid on a bigger issue. This relates to another program in San Francisco, harm reduction, in which people are provided with the tools to do drugs like heroin for free with the ideology that these people will do drugs anyway at least let them be safer when doing it. Perhaps we should use different solutions to food insecurity or lack of accessibility to acquire basic needs instead of assuming small gestures will set a person's life on the right track.
