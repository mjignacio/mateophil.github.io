## How Would this Increase Justice

With the ability to view more specifically, where people could be in need of assistance before they resort to crime, we can momentarily reduce their strain in at least one facet. This should relieve people of not only their momentary concerns like hunger or self preservation but also their mental health knowing that they will always have options. One less thing to worry about financially for the day. Education on other resources around the community can be presented to those who visit so they can learn of more reliable and consistent forms of outreach. 

The analysis also takes into account the availability of other resource outlets and community outreach to best decide who needs help and to bring justice for those with historically less offered to them. For areas with historically more resources, the findings can be presented so that they can be informed on these potential harms and then create their own strategy. The predictions and analysis can be presented to non-profit organizations like local food banks or churches to give them ideas of locations for food drives or clothes drives. Of course the businesses could use the information to better protect their stock and know what to expect.
