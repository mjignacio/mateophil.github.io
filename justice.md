## Appropriate Contexts

Two appropriate contexts for the model would be where merchandise can be tracked and where shoplifting is prevalent enough to be recorded. This means grocery stores and department stores. Typically large corporations but local businesses also can suffer as they do not have the money for security measures like large companies do.

Shoplifting from grocery stores is one of the intended areas to improve with the help of the model. Giving back to the communities that deserve help is the main goal so if it is observed that a market is susceptible to food being shoplifted this will be analyzed and presented to an organization who will hopefully recognize the issue and deploy their resources to help. Food pantries offer their services to those in need where they can have nutritious food provided. Mobile food pantries are also a method of food provision whose placement can be provided by the predictions and analysis. 

Clothing stores are the other ideal context for the deployment of the model. As mentioned in the data collection methods section, clothing items typically have EAS and RFID tags to deter theft and keep track of the garment’s information. This advantage allows for faster and more accurate data collection. A shirt with an RFID tag sewn into the pocket will be tripped by the sensors at the front of the store and this information of where the store is and the exact kind of item will be collected. This is exactly the data needed to create predictions of where shoplifting will occur and what kind of clothing. This context is perfect for the data collection and modeling phases. 

## Inappropriate Contexts

An inappropriate context would mean that the predictions could potentially harm or misrepresent the community. If the model was used then the results were framed as an evaluation of the status of safety in the area this could be controversial. There are valid reasons to interpret shoplifting as a proxy of danger but it is not a violent crime and the protocols for people that would come encounter shoplifters tell them to remove themselves from the situation and put their safety above all. This situation could occur if the model is given to the police. Or it could occur if lobbyists wanted to support the idea that a local government is failing to stop crime with the predictions. 


## How Would this Increase Justice

With the ability to view more specifically, where people could be in need of assistance before they resort to crime, we can momentarily reduce their strain in at least one facet. This should relieve people of not only their momentary concerns like hunger or self preservation but also their mental health knowing that they will always have options. One less thing to worry about financially for the day. Education on other resources around the community can be presented to those who visit so they can learn of more reliable and consistent forms of outreach. 

The analysis also takes into account the availability of other resource outlets and community outreach to best decide who needs help and to bring justice for those with historically less offered to them. For areas with historically more resources, the findings can be presented so that they can be informed on these potential harms and then create their own strategy. The predictions and analysis can be presented to non-profit organizations like local food banks or churches to give them ideas of locations for food drives or clothes drives. Of course the businesses could use the information to better protect their stock and know what to expect. 

## Contexts when Revisions are Neccesary for Ethical Reasons

Using the model to predict crime with the intent to dispatch police is a noble intention but I believe that it is very susceptible to producing the same results as it is trained on. Since a consequence of this use is putting people in jail I believe there is a higher responsibility for the model and analysis to lack racial bias. However it cannot be analyzed in the same way that the original context is. The historical context of why some areas have more crime is integral to the original purpose but will probably not be important to the cops making arrests on their patrol routes. 

This context would probably require data that is already collected by police departments but is intrinsically biased. Making predictions and then sending police to the areas to stop crime then creates a loop that will probably disproportionately affect marginalized groups. As we’ve seen in class being unbiased is virtually impossible and the data that would be used for a model of this purpose would probably be very biased. More likely than not resulting in harmful tendencies so I think it should be avoided. 

This model is based on a project utilized by LAPD called PredPol, now Geolitica, that takes crime data and predicts hotspots where crime will occur throughout the day. It informs a department's patrol habits so that they can be dispatched where it is likely they will be needed. And it was criticized for targeting minority neighborhoods so we’ve seen a real world application of this context which was allegedly harmful. For this reason I do not think the model should be used at all in the context of positioning police.

One context that is not as easily remedied is the mental and psychological causes that make people want to participate in shoplifting. From anecdotal evidence shoplifting is common in California is middle school and high school students from middle class areas. The reason for this shoplifting is a thrill or peer pressure. The privacy of children is even more important and they are not aware of how impactful their actions are, this requires change for the model. Typically shoplifting will occur close to the schools because young students don’t have cars to go far and if they are with their parents they are discouraged from attempting
