## Contexts when Revisions are Neccesary for Ethical Reasons

Using the model to predict crime with the intent to dispatch police is a noble intention but I believe that it is very susceptible to producing the same results as it is trained on. Since a consequence of this use is putting people in jail I believe there is a higher responsibility for the model and analysis to lack racial bias. However it cannot be analyzed in the same way that the original context is. The historical context of why some areas have more crime is integral to the original purpose but will probably not be important to the cops making arrests on their patrol routes. 

This context would probably require data that is already collected by police departments but is intrinsically biased. Making predictions and then sending police to the areas to stop crime then creates a loop that will probably disproportionately affect marginalized groups. As we’ve seen in class being unbiased is virtually impossible and the data that would be used for a model of this purpose would probably be very biased. More likely than not resulting in harmful tendencies so I think it should be avoided. 

This model is based on a project utilized by LAPD called PredPol, now Geolitica, that takes crime data and predicts hotspots where crime will occur throughout the day. It informs a department's patrol habits so that they can be dispatched where it is likely they will be needed. And it was criticized for targeting minority neighborhoods so we’ve seen a real world application of this context which was allegedly harmful. For this reason I do not think the model should be used at all in the context of positioning police.

One context that is not as easily remedied is the mental and psychological causes that make people want to participate in shoplifting. From anecdotal evidence shoplifting is common in California is middle school and high school students from middle class areas. The reason for this shoplifting is a thrill or peer pressure. The privacy of children is even more important and they are not aware of how impactful their actions are, this requires change for the model. Typically shoplifting will occur close to the schools because young students don’t have cars to go far and if they are with their parents they are discouraged from attempting
